# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0x1: January 3, 2016
*1.5 Hours*

**Today's Progress**: I have set up the environment, downloaded React, Webpack, Babel and React Router. I have also set up a basic skeleton.

**Thoughts:** I am quite happy that I actually got out of my bed and went coding even though I have been quite tired after I came home from a long day at school. I hope that my commitment will not fade and that I will keep the momentum (rather small at the moment, but we'll get there, don't worry ðŸ‘Œ ).

**What I plan to do next:** I plan to set up the backend and implement an authentication for an authentication page. I will also set up Sequelize.js to work with the database.
